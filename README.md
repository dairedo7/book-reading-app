This project was written for educational purposes only - both frontend and backend parts of application were written as the part of a team project.
Redux toolkit was used as an instrument for reducement of the boilerplate code, which also provides a convenient way to set up the store and handle redux actions and state's manipulations. Moreover, various types of hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer as well as custome hooks such as useForm) were used to manage the state and manipulate with lifecycle of react's components.

Emotion library was used to write the css styles: this library reduces the boilerplate code by letting you use the props to pass the styles to the component. It also supports vendor-prefixing, nested selectors, media queries as well as allow to style components directly.

The project was deployed on the "Vercel" cloud platform - the link for the frontend application is as follows:
